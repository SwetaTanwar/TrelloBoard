# TrelloBoard

This project is emulating the structure of trello. 

Featues:

1. Basic Structure
There are 2 columns that stretch along the device height and contain cards with a number on it.

2. Card addition
Functionality for the `Add` button where on clicking the button for the particular column, a card is added with a number signifying its position when added. Cards can be added only till there is space in the column. Once the column is filled the button needs to be disabled with some style marker.

3. Toggle label
By tapping on the card the color of the label can change. User can switch between any 5-10 label colors/no label by tapping on it repeatedly.

4. Add More Columns
User has a button available to add more column each having all the same features as above

5. Moving Card in column
Users can drag a card in the column up and down. The card can be dropped in between other cards but the number on it will not change.
